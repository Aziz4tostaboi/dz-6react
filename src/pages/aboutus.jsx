                While learning web development creating a website with a Login and Registration Form could be the best project for beginners to intermediate-level web developers.
Today in this blog you will learn how to build a website that includes a Login and Registration Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I have previously designed many websites with Login and Registration Forms, they were created as separate entities.
As you can see on the given image of the Website with the Login & Signup Form that you will be going to learn to create today. The website will have a navigation bar with a logo and nav links with a button that will toggle the form. To toggle the login and registration form there is a button at the bottom of the form.

        </div>
